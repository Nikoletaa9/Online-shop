		a healthy lifestyle and strengthen the body, humans need to consume minerals daily. <br> Rocks and minerals play a valuable role in natural systems such as providing habitat like the cliffs at Grand Canyon National Park <br> where endangered
		condors nest, or provide soil nutrients in Redwood where the tallest trees in the world grow.<br> Rocks and minerals are important for learning about earth materials, structure, and systems.<br> Studying these natural objects incorporates
		an understanding of earth science, chemistry, physics, and math.<br> The learner can walk away with an understanding of crystal geometry, the ability to visualize 3-D objects, or knowing rates of crystallization.<br> Natural objects, such
		as rocks and minerals, contribute to the beauty and wonderment of the National Parks and should be left, <br> as they were found, so that others can experience a sense of discovery.
